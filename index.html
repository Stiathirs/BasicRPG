    <h1>Welcome to <b>BasicRPG!</b></h1>
    <p><b>BasicRPG</b> is an RPG-style grinding game where you beat monsters to become stronger!</p>
    <p>Do you get bored from grinding? Don't worry, this game makes it even more boring by having no graphics! But at least there's some different mechanics to make up for it I guess :P</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kill monsters and level up to become stronger!</li>
      <li>Get gold and become rich!</li>
      <li>Die a horrible death I guess?</li>
      <li>Get weapons and armor!</li>
      <li>Die again?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>Oh, hello there! I am Stiathirs the Protogen, the sole developer of BasicRPG. This game has been a bit of a passion project of mine which started in the summer of 2018.</p>
    <p>Development has been on and off throughout the years, and I eventually stopped working on the project in the fall of 2019. The project originally started because of something I had saw in the Twine Cookbook, which was RPG mechanics. This inspired me to make a game which envolved RPG-like mechanics, and to push Twine (and Harlowe) to it's limits. Now that I've come back in 2022, I've seen just how terrible my game was, and wanted to improve it.</p>
    <p>Over time, I wasted away developing this game that I thought nobody would even want to play. However, this didn't seem to be completely true, as I actually bothered to write over 100 more kilobytes of text improving the game and expanding upon what was originally just a concept which would never come to completion. If the past me looked at this without any knowledge of why I continued working on this abandoned project, they'd laugh at the fact I bothered to expand it.</p>
    <p>Over the course of developing this game, I've learned about just how much potential the Harlowe engine (and Twine in general) really has. It's not just a gamebook maker, it's an entire game development engine. Granted, it might not be your traditional game development engine like Unity or Unreal, it's still very powerful and allows you to make a game that nobody else would bother doing in either.</p>
    <p>Funny thing is, I used to want to be a gamedev. Around the time I abandoned this project back in 2019 was when I realized I didn't want to be a professional gamedev. Now that I've come back to this game and started developing it again, I realize I want game making to be a hobby, not a career. I want to enjoy what I'm making, and not have someone boss me around to finish a game that doesn't interest me.</p>
    <p>Overall, this has been (and still is) a fun project to work on, and I hope that you can see the passion I've put into this game. Remember to revisit projects you abandon, maybe you'll re-ignite your passion for it.</p>

        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Reworked all <code>(set:)</code> macros to use <code>to</code> instead of <code>=</code></li>
      <ul>
        <li>This is due to how Harlowe 3.3 will change how macros work, which will break <code>(set:)</code> statements that use <code>=</code>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Exploit Patch - 3.9</h3>

    <br>
    <h3>File Size Reduction Update - 3.8</h3>
    <h4>Goddamn just use <code>(rerun:)</code> and not <code>(replace:)</code> the hook with a whole copy of itself</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Replaced the <code>(replace:)</code> usage with <code>(rerun:)</code>, as all the <code>(replace:)</code>'s did was replace it with a new copy of itself, causing massive increases in file size.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This also lets me make the links for buying stuff back to the full text</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where activating the Vigorous trait when the player has full health would cause <code>($clamp:)</code> to throw an error.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Created a <code>($clamp:)</code> macro</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Replaced all <code>(set: $value to expression)(if:$value > otherexpression)[(set:$value to otherexpression)]</code> with <code>(set: $value to ($clamp: expression,0,otherexpression))</code></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Updater Hotfix: Fixed the infinite updating loop - 3.6</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The more you tier up this trait, the more information you have access to.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Introduced an update script that auto-detects if you're using an old version's player datamap</li>
      <li>Reworded a bunch of screens</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Character Sheet Update - 3.4</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Player vars now in a datamap</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Saves will be wiped, as all of the game's function has been rewritten to use it instead of the old system</li>
      </ul>
      <li>You can name yourself at least i guess</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>Data has been wiped, and existing saves will not load.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Continued Optimizations - 3.3</h3>
    <h4>Fully optimized the shop, optimized the inventory, and optimized the rest screen.</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Removed all <code>(live:)</code> macro usage in the Skills screen</li>

      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Event Hotfix: Fixed the decimal health bug - 3.1</h3>

      <li>You no longer start with gold</li>
      <ul>
