    <h1>Welcome to <b>Basic RPG!</b></h1>
    <p><b>Basic RPG</b> is an RPG-style grinding game where you beat monsters to become stronger!</p>
    <p>Do you get bored from grinding? Don't worry, this game makes it even more boring by having no graphics! But at least there's some different mechanics to make up for it I guess :P</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kill monsters and level up to become stronger!</li>
      <li>Get gold and become rich!</li>
      <li>Die a horrible death I guess?</li>
      <li>Get weapons and armor!</li>
      <li>Die again?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>Oh, hello there! I am Stiathirs the Protogen, the sole developer of Basic RPG. This game has been a bit of a passion project of mine which started in the summer of 2018.</p>
    <p>Development has been on and off throughout the years, and I eventually stopped working on the project in the fall of 2019. The project originally started because of something I had saw in the Twine Cookbook, which was Dice Rolling and Player Statistics. This inspired me to make a game which envolved RPG-like mechanics, and to push Twine (and Harlowe) to its limits. Now that I've come back in 2022, I've seen just how terrible my game was, and wanted to improve it.</p>
    <p>Over time, I wasted away developing this game that I thought nobody would even want to play. However, this didn't seem to be completely true, as I actually bothered to write over 48 more kilobytes of text improving the game and expanding upon what was originally just a concept which would never come to completion. If the past me looked at this without any knowledge of why I continued working on this abandoned project, they'd laugh at the fact I bothered to expand it.</p>
    <p>Over the course of developing this game, I've learned about just how much potential the Harlowe engine (and Twine in general) really has. It's not just a gamebook maker, it's an entire game development engine. Granted, it might not be your traditional game development engine like Unity or Unreal, it's still very powerful and allows you to make a game that nobody else would bother doing in either.</p>
    <p>Funny thing is, I used to want to be a gamedev. Around the time I abandoned this project back in 2019 was when I realized I didn't want to be a professional gamedev. Now that I've come back to this game and started developing it again, I realize I want game making to be a hobby, not a career. I want to enjoy what I'm making, and not have someone boss me around to finish a game that doesn't interest me.</p>
    <p>Overall, this has been (and still is) a fun project to work on, and I hope that you can see the passion I've put into this game. Remember to revisit projects you abandon, maybe you'll re-ignite your passion for it.</p>
